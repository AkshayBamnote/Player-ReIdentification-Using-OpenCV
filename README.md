## Compared Videos
1. **final_output_with_ocr_and_stable_ids4.mp4**
2. **output_reidentified_video_2.mp4**

## Evaluation Criteria
- **ID Consistency**: Do players retain the same ID across reappearances or different views?
- **ID Switching**: Are there frequent misassignments or ID swaps?
- **Clarity and Tracking**: Is it easy to follow player identities visually?
- **Visual Presentation**: Are overlays (like IDs, bounding boxes) readable and neatly placed?
- **Runtime Smoothness**: Does it simulate real-time well without glitches or lag?

## Results
